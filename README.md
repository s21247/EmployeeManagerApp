##EmployeeManagerApp
Aplication that lets you manage adding/editing/deleting employees.
Fullstack application with front and back-end written from scratch. I have used helped from amigoscode since it's my first fullstack app. The whole purpose of the project is to
learn angular and combine back-end with front with HTTP.
